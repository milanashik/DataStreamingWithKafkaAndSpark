Project Topics:

Real time data streaming and analytic system 

Description: 
A system that is capable of streaming real time data and analyze them and client will be able to visualize them using UI

Data source: to be decided 
Possibilities: Cryptocurrency, stock, health, eCommerce sites or other public APIs

Kafka is generally used for two broad classes of applications:

Building real-time streaming data pipelines that reliably get data between systems or applications
Building real-time streaming applications that transform or react to the streams of data

About Spark
Spark Streaming API enables scalable, high-throughput, fault-tolerant stream processing of live data streams. Data can be ingested from many sources like Kafka, Flume, Twitter, etc., and can be processed using complex algorithms such as high-level functions like map, reduce, join and window. Finally, processed data can be pushed out to filesystems, databases, and live dash-boards.

TECHNOLOGIES:

Apache Kafka and Apache Spark, memSQL, docker containers, kubernetes(optional for managing containers and deployment), pipelines, connector 
BI tools for visualization (Tableau)
Other technologies: for frontend and backend (need some more research)


Challenges:
Finding the right data source
Setting up the environment in laptop (docker is used but still resources may not be enough)
